This is a modern Cookiecutter template that can be used to initiate a Python project with all the necessary tools for development, testing, and deployment. See [Features](#features) for a list of capabilities.

## Quickstart

---

**NOTE**: Make sure you have performed the
[initial system configuration](#system-configuration-one-time) **once**.

---

On your local machine, navigate to the directory in which you want to
create a project directory, and run the following two commands:

```
cookiecutter https://github.com/partsnap/partsnap-cookiecutter-poetry.git
```

Create a repository on GitHub, and then run the following commands, replacing `<project-name>`, with the name that you gave the Github repository and
`<github_author_handle>` with your Github username.

```bash
cd <project_name>
git init -b main
git add .
git commit -m "Init commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:<github_author_handle>/<project_name>.git
git push -u origin main
```

Finally, install the environment and the pre-commit hooks with

```bash
make install
```

You are now ready to start development on your project! The CI/CD
pipeline will be triggered when you open a pull request, merge to main,
or when you create a new release.

To finalize the set-up for publishing to PyPi or Artifactory, see [here](./features/publishing.md#set-up-for-pypi). For activating the automatic documentation with MkDocs, see [here](./features/mkdocs.md#enabling-the-documentation-on-github). To enable the code coverage reports, see [here](./features/codecov.md).

## System Configuration (One Time)

install [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/)
make sure you run ``pipx ensurepath`` and restart your shell

install [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) if you haven't done so already
install [direnv](https://direnv.net/). On the latest OSX version do:

```bash
  $ brew install direnv
  $ echo 'eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

configure [direnv](https://direnv.net/man/direnv.toml.1.html) toml file to trust our org

```bash
  $ mkdir -p ~/.config/direnv/
  $ touch ~/.config/direnv/config.toml
```

copy the following in your `config.toml` file (you can change the path to wherever your GitHub root is. Note that this will trust `ALL` directories underneath)

```
  [global]
  warn_timeout="20s"
  [whitelist]
  prefix = ["~/github/partsnap"]
```

install cookiecutter

```bash
pipx install cookiecutter
```

- CI/CD with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- Pre-commit hooks with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
- Code quality with [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff), [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [deptry](https://github.com/fpgmaas/deptry/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- Publishing to [Pypi](https://pypi.org) or [Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory) by creating a new release on GitHub
- Testing and coverage with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/) and [codecov](https://about.codecov.io/)
- Documentation with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
- Compatibility testing for multiple versions of Python with [Tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/)
- Containerization with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Development environment with [VSCode devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)
