# Dependency management with Poetry


The generated repository will uses [Poetry](https://python-Poetry.org/)
for its dependency management. When you have created your repository
using this cookiecutter template, a Poetry environment is pre-configured
in `pyproject.toml` and `Poetry.toml`. All you need to do is add your
project-specific dependencies with

``` bash
poetry add <package>
```

and then install the environment with

``` bash
make install
```

By default, the environment is created in a `.venv` folder, so you can
easily start an interactive shell within the environment with
`poetry shell`.
