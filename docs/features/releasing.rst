Releasing from Github
---------------------------------------------

When ``publish_to`` is set to ``"pypi"`` or ``"artifactory"``, the ``.github/on-release-main.yml`` publishes the code to
`Pypi <https://pypi.org>`_ or `Artifactory <https://jfrog.com/artifactory>`_ respectively whenever a new release is
made. 

Before you can trigger the release workflow, some environment variables are required. 

Set-up for Pypi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to release to Pypi, the secret ``PYPI_TOKEN`` should be set in your repository. In your Github repository, navigate to ``Settings > Secrets > Actions`` and press
``New repository secret``. As the name of the secret, set ``PYPI_TOKEN``. Then, in a new tab go to your `Pypi Account settings <https://pypi.org/manage/account/>`_ 
and select `Add API token`. Copy and paste the token in the ``Value`` field for the Github secret in your first tab, and you're all set!

Set-up for Artifactory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to release to `Artifactory`, visit your Artifactory instance and open ``Quick setup``. You should see something like this:

.. image:: ../images/artifactory.png
   :width: 700

You should add these as secrets to your repository with the names ``ARTIFACTORY_URL``, ``ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME`` and ``ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD`` respectively.
To do so, in your Github repository, navigate to  ``Settings > Secrets > Actions`` and create a secret by pressing ``New repository secret`` to add the secrets one by one.

How to trigger a release?
-------------------------

To trigger a new release, click the ``Draft a new release`` button on your repository's homepage. If you fail to find
the button, you could also directly visit ``https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>/releases/new``. 

Give your release a title, add a new tag in the form ``*.*.*`` where the ``*``'s are alphanumeric. To finish, press ``Publish
release``.

Releasing locally
----------------------

It is also possible to release locally, although it is not recommended. To do so, set the repository secrets listed in the sections above 
as environment variables on your local machine instead, and run

.. code-block:: bash
    
    make build-and-publish
