# Documentation with MkDocs


If `mkdocs` is set to `"y"`, documentation of your project is
automatically added using
[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). Next to that, if
`"include_github_actions"` is set to `"y"`, the documentation is
automatically deployed to your `gh-pages` branch, and made available at
`https://<github_handle>.github.io/<project_name>/`.

To view the documentation locally, simply run

``` bash
make docs
```

This command will generate and build your documentation, and start the server locally so you can access it at 
<http://localhost:8000>.

## Enabling the documentation on GitHub

To enable your documentation on GitHub, first create a [new release](./cicd.md#how-to-trigger-a-release).

Then, in your repository, navigate to ``Settings > Code and Automation > Pages``. If you succesfully created a new release,
you should see a notification saying `` Your site is ready to be published at https://<author_github_handle>.github.io/<project_name>/``.

To finalize deploying your documentation, under ``Source``, select the branch ``gh-pages``. Your documentation should then be live within a few minutes.

## Documenting docstrings

The generated project also converts all
your docstrings into legible documentation. By default, the project is
configured to work with
[google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) style
docstrings.

An example of a Google style docstring:

``` python
def function_with_pep484_type_annotations(param1: int, param2: str) -> bool:
"""Example function with PEP 484 type annotations.

Args:
    param1: The first parameter.
    param2: The second parameter.

Returns:
    The return value. True for success, False otherwise.
```
