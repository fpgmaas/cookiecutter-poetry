- Testing with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/)
- Documentation with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
- Static type checking with [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## Example CI/CD Pipeline

[![Example pipeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fpgmaas/cookiecutter-poetry/main/static/images/pipeline.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fpgmaas/cookiecutter-poetry/main/static/images/pipeline.png)

## Quickstart

On your local machine, navigate to the directory in which you want to
create a project directory, and run the following two commands:

``` bash
pip install cookiecutter-poetry 
ccp
```

Alternatively, install `cookiecutter` and directly pass the URL to this
Github repository to the `cookiecutter` command:

``` bash
pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter https://github.com/fpgmaas/cookiecutter-poetry.git
```

Then run the following commands, replacing `<project-name>`, with the
name that you also gave the Github repository and
`<github_author_handle>` with your Github username.

``` bash
cd <project_name>
git init -b main
git add .
git commit -m "Init commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:<github_author_handle>/<project_name>.git
git push -u origin main
```

Finally, install the environment with `make install`.

You are now ready to start development on your project! The CI/CD
pipeline will be triggered when you open a pull request, merge to main,
or when you create a new release.

To finalize the set-up for publishing to PyPi or Artifactory, see
